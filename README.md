# cppcfg ‚öôÔ∏è

#### Simple C++ library for parsing custom .cfg files.

## About üìò

**Hey!** I always had a need to be able to add config files to my programs. I just like to have an ability to change some values in file and see the program process them in many different ways. But this always meant that I had to write myself a .cfg file parser to load those values... So I decided to make this library.This is my first C++ library released publicly so it might be kinda bad but I will try to improve it as I progress with my coding skills lmao.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Place `cppcfg.hpp` in your _include_ folder. Then place `thecppcfg.cpp` file in your _src_. Remember to change `#include "cppcfg.hpp"` in `thecppcfg.cpp` to reflect your file structure. Then, for every configuration file, create new ConfigurationFile object and pass the path to your .cfg file as an argument.

If the config changes during execution of your program and you need to re-read it, just use `config.reload()` method.

## Syntax of .cfg files üìù

If you want to create a config file and be able to parse it using this library, you must stick to some rules.

- In one line there can only be one pair: `<key>=<value>`
- You can only use `a-z,A-Z,0-9` symbols when defining keys. No spaces allowed. _You can use underscores tho._
- Do not use spaces between key and '=' and between '=' and value.
- Strings have to be put into `""`. Chars have to be put into `''`.
- When creating decimal values, you can put `f` at the end to make them float, not double.
- To create boolean value, just type `true` or `false`.
- Blank lines are allowed.
- Lines beginning with `#` symbol are treated as comments and are skipped.

If this is confusing, don't be upset. Just look at the example shown below.

## Example code ‚å®Ô∏è

**config.cfg**

```ini
# Exemplary config.

hello="world"
ultimateAnswerToLifeTheUniverseAndEverything=42
someRandomNumber=21.37
someRandomNumberButFloat=326.23f
idkJustAChar=';'
isThisRepoAnyGood=true

# Some more values...
check=false
fun_number=82471.30f

# This library only cares about first and last char of your string to be ".
# This means that you don't have to escape special characters.
hey_look="you dont have to escape special chars here / | " "

```

**main.cpp**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "cppcfg.hpp"

int main()
{
    ConfigurationFile config("config.cfg");
    std::cout << config.getString("hello") << "\n";
    std::cout << config.getInt("ultimateAnswerToLifeTheUniverseAndEverything") << "\n";
    std::cout << config.getDouble("someRandomNumber") << "\n";
    std::cout << config.getFloat("someRandomNumberButFloat") << "\n";
    std::cout << config.getChar("idkJustAChar") << "\n";
    std::cout << config.getBool("isThisRepoAnyGood") << "\n";
}
```

**Output:**

```
world
42
21.37
326.23
;
1
```
